# InSight

The InSight framework enables non-line-of-sight (NLOS) classification, error correction, and anchor selection on resource-constrained UWB (ultra-wideband) devices. The [Model Generator](Model Generator/readme.md) module is designed to fascilitate the creation and deployment of efficient machine learning models that meet user-specific requirements (RAM, flash memory, and runtime) and convert the best model to C code. The [Embedded NLOS Engine](Embedded NLOS Engine/readme.md) module then uses the models to provide NLOS classification and error correction to any service. In this example we build the embedded NLOS engine into the Contiki-NG operating system.

InSight is designed to be configurable and the components exchangeable. Feel free to add, modify, or exchange any part to better suit your needs.
